Hi, this is vanilla JS project starter. It creates folders and files with one command.

Install npm package manager first then just copy the package.json from this repo into your project folder and hit <b>npm run project-init</b>

<b>npm run watch</b> will open live server in browser compile sass etc

for more take a look into script scetion in the package.json file

Also I've added ready to go linters config files. Copy .editorconfig, .eslintrc.json and .stylelintrc.json to the root folder.

Cheers, feel free to share
